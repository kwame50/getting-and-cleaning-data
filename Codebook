Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data. 
â€¢The site where the data was obtained:

Laying
Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
